    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "Many cultural and folk stories are slowly disappearing or failing to engage younger, digital-native audiences due to lack of interactive and modern formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective\n",
    "The objective of this project is to design an AI-based storytelling system that uses large language models to generate engaging, interactive cultural narratives that help preserve and promote cultural heritage.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real-World Relevance\n",
    "This system can be used in education, museums, digital archives, and cultural platforms to make traditional stories more accessible and engaging for future generations.\n"

    "\n",
    "### Input Sources\n",
    "The system uses cultural content such as folk tales, historical narratives, and oral traditions as input. These inputs can be provided in text form and optionally as audio narratives.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Characteristics\n",
    "- Cultural stories from regional traditions\n",
    "- Multilingual textual content\n",
    "- Narratives with moral or historical significance\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Preparation\n",
    "Since this project focuses on generative storytelling, no large labeled dataset is required. \n",
    "Prompts are manually crafted to represent cultural themes, regions, and moral lessons.\n"

    "## 3. Model / System Design\n",
    "\n",
    "### AI Technique Used\n",
    "This project uses a Large Language Model (LLM) for natural language generation to create cultural stories based on user prompts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### System Workflow\n",
    "1. User provides a cultural theme, region, or moral.\n",
    "2. The prompt is sent to the language model.\n",
    "3. The model generates a culturally inspired story.\n",
    "4. Optional branching allows interactive storytelling (choose-your-own-path).\n",
    "5. The final story is displayed to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Design Justification\n",
    "LLMs are well-suited for storytelling tasks due to their ability to understand context, generate coherent narratives, and adapt tone and style based on prompts. This makes them effective for preserving and retelling cultural stories in engaging ways.\n"

    "## 4. Core Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Story Generation Logic\n",
    "The core implementation consists of a simple function that takes a user-defined cultural prompt and generates a story based on that input. The prompt includes information such as region, audience type, and moral theme.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prompt Engineering\n",
    "Prompts are carefully designed to guide the language model toward culturally relevant storytelling. Including region-specific and moral cues helps improve contextual accuracy and narrative coherence.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation Details\n",
    "In this prototype implementation, a simplified story generation function is used to demonstrate the workflow. This can later be replaced with an actual LLM API or open-source language model without changing the overall system design.\n"

    "## 5. Evaluation & Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluation Approach\n",
    "Since this is a generative AI system, the evaluation is primarily qualitative in nature. The generated stories are assessed based on narrative coherence, cultural relevance, and clarity of the intended moral.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sample Outputs\n",
    "Sample stories generated by the system demonstrate that the model can adapt storytelling style and tone according to the cultural theme and user prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Performance Analysis\n",
    "The system produces coherent and engaging narratives for a wide range of cultural prompts. However, output quality is highly dependent on prompt specificity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations\n",
    "- Evaluation is subjective and not based on numerical metrics\n",
    "- Cultural accuracy depends on prompt design\n",
    "- The system does not verify historical authenticity\n"
