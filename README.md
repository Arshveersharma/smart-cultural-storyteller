Smart Cultural Storyteller

What is it?
Smart Cultural Storyteller is a prototype that uses AI to create stories inspired by different cultures. Basically, it mixes creative writing and technology, relying on prompt engineering and big language models to bring these stories to life.

Why build it?
The main idea is to show how AI can help us keep cultural stories alive—and make them fun and easy for younger, digital-first generations to enjoy.

How does it work?
- Uses prompts to kickstart storytelling
- Runs a simulated large language model workflow, so you don’t need to be online
- Looks at the stories it creates and checks their quality
- Always keeps ethical and responsible AI use in mind

What’s inside the repo?
- smart-cultural-storyteller.ipynb: This is the main notebook where everything happens and where you can see how the project gets evaluated.

One more thing
This is just a prototype to show off the workflow and how prompts shape the stories. If you want, you can connect it to real LLM APIs later on and expand it even more.
